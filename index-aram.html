        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          Aram is one of the random pick game mode of league of legends where players are randomly assigned a role with the possibility
          to reroll if collected enough 'reroll points'. Thus, a game's outcome is mainly affected by which champions each
          team get. Since league of legends has a powerful system for matching players of the same level, this program will
          predict game outcomes only from champion assignments. In other words, the program treats Aram game as a card game
          between two players (teams), each of them is holding 5 cards randomly picked from a pool. There could be over 600
          million possible games. Naive bayes and KNN are used as learning method. The program is extremely simple by using
          Sklearn's api.

          <h4>Data</h4>
          <p>
            Around 25000 aram match records are downloaded through Riot API. Training set 23000, testing 1000, validation set 1000 with
            10 fold CV. Each record is represented by an array of length 11 where the first 5 entries, second 5 entries contains
            the champion ids of team 1 and team 2 and the last entry is either 1 or 0 indicating whether team1 win or lose
            in that game. Riot has just updated their API and made it difficult to retrive matches so it took me 80 hours
            to obtain the dataset.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model"> Bag-of-words<a/>. Expanding each match record to
              an array of (2 * num_champions + 1) entries. Each entry becomes a boolean represents whether champion xxx
              appears on team 1 (or team 2 or the second half array). The last bit represents the outcome as before.

              <p> Overall: 67%
              </p>
              <p> Although the overall accuracy is not that good, but the programs always catches unevenly assigned matches 
                correctly. For example, instead of taking the predicted label from NB, we can first check the actual probs
                for each class and the larger the differece, the more confident we are about the result. [0.45 , 0.55] for 
                [team1 win prob, team2 win prob] does't tell us much useful information but a [0.8, 0.2] one does.
